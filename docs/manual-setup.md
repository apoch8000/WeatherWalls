# Manual setup

Despite this is not recommended, you can choose to manually download the files and extract them to the right locations. Follow the steps below:

1. In your **iCloud Drive**, find the `/Shortcuts` folder.

2. In this directory **create a new folder** named 'WeatherWalls' (= `/Shortcuts/WeatherWalls`). 

3. In this directory **create a folder for the theme** you want to download and **capitalize the name** (= `/Shortcuts/WeatherWalls/BEACH`).

4. **Download** the theme from above with the according foldername you just created.

5. **Extract** the contents of the theme into your theme folder (= `/Shortcuts/WeatherWalls/BEACH/clear.jpg`).


You have now manually installed a theme and can now run the WeatherWalls shortcut.
